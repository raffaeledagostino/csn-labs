# Complex and Social Networks Laboratories

Python and R implementations and analysis of network growth models and empirical networks.

## Topics

- **Network Growth Models**: Barabási-Albert (preferential and random attachment), no-growth variants
- **Syntactic Dependency Networks**: Cross-linguistic analysis of 21 languages

## Techniques

- Preferential attachment simulations (stubs method)
- Statistical analysis: maximum likelihood estimation, model selection (AIC/BIC)
- Degree distribution fitting (power-law, exponential, Gaussian)
- Parallel computing with multicore support
- Network topology metrics and visualization

## Stack
Python, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas
